# plupload2-angular
This is an AngularJS wrapper for plupload2 plugin.
Some of the initial code is similar to/taken from Sahusoft's [plupload-angular-directive](http://sahusoftcom.github.io/plupload-angular-directive/).

Available for install via bower:
<br />
<code>bower install plupload2-angular --save</code>

Feel free to fork it and modify it. The build process is very basic:
<br />
<code>gulp build</code>

Currently used plupload version is Plupload 2.1.4 GPLv2. You can find it on [Plupload.com](http://plupload.com/)

There are no big plans for future since it is a quick-fix, though better build workflow, tests and dependency management might be introduced in near future.
